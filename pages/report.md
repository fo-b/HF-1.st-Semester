# Final Report

## Introduction

This report provides an overview of the successful installation and setup of AWX, an open-source infrastructure automation tool, on the maas.io private cloud. The project was undertaken by Fabio Beti and aimed to implement a robust and scalable automation platform for managing and orchestrating infrastructure resources

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the project were as follows:

-   Install and configure AWX on the maas.io private cloud
- Ensure seamless integration between AWX and the underlying infrastructure components
- Enable efficient and centralized management of infrastructure resources.
- Facilitate automation of tasks such as provisioning, configuration, and deployment
- Establish secure access controls and implement appropriate security measures

## Planning and Preparation

-   Conducted a thorough assessment of the infrastructure requirements and identified the necessary resources
- Defined a detailed project plan, including the allocation of tasks, milestones, and deadlines
- Ensured alignment with the client's expectations and objectives

## Infrastructure Provisioning

- Utilized the maas.io private cloud to provision the required infrastructure components
- Configured the network and security settings to establish connectivity and enable secure communication

## AWX Installation

-  Deployed the AWX installation package on the maas.io private cloud.
- Ensured compatibility with the infrastructure components and software dependencies.
- Configured the necessary settings, including database connections, authentication mechanisms, and system preferences

## Integration and Testing

- Integrated AWX with the underlying infrastructure, including cloud providers, virtualization platforms, and networking components.
- Conducted comprehensive testing to verify the functionality and stability of AWX.
- Validated the successful execution of automation tasks, such as job scheduling, playbooks, and workflow management

## Security and Access Control

- Implemented robust security measures to safeguard the AWX platform and the infrastructure it manages.
- Configured authentication mechanisms, including user accounts, role-based access control, and multi-factor authentication.
- Applied encryption and secure communication protocols to protect sensitive data

## Achievements and Highlights

The installation and setup of AWX on the maas.io private cloud were completed successfully, yielding the following achievements and highlights:

- fully automated tmp key creation
- GitHub API integration
- AWS API, CLI integration
- AWX CLI integration


## Smooth Integration

AWX was seamlessly integrated with the maas.io private cloud and various infrastructure components, ensuring efficient communication and resource management

## Centralized Automation

The AWX platform enabled the centralized management and automation of infrastructure resources, allowing for streamlined provisioning, configuration, and deployment processes

## Scalability and Flexibility

The maas.io private cloud provided a scalable and flexible environment for AWX, accommodating future growth and the addition of new infrastructure resources

## Enhanced Security

The implemented security measures ensured the protection of AWX and the infrastructure, safeguarding sensitive data and preventing unauthorized access

## Robust Testing and Validation

Comprehensive testing procedures were carried out to validate the functionality and stability of AWX, ensuring its reliability in production environments

## Conclusion

The successful installation and setup of AWX on the maas.io private cloud have established a powerful automation platform for managing infrastructure resources. The project achieved its objectives, enabling centralized management, streamlined operations, and enhanced security. The implementation lays the foundation for increased efficiency and productivity in infrastructure management processes

## Recommendations

Based on the successful completion of this project, the following recommendations are proposed for future enhancements:

- rewrite script and print out the entire cloud-init file
- build AWX in K8S
