## :writing_hand: What's the purpose of this?

Meanwhile, having your own project under your responsibility and drive is always a new challenge for everybody. During the further education, it was clear that at the end of the semester I needed to prove anyhow my knowledge to the lecturer of the university, right? Well here I am and [here](docs/clarification.md) you can see the clarification of my work for the first semester.
