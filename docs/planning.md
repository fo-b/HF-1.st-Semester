# :exclamation: Planning

## Time schedule

The only time schedule that I actually use for this project is the roadmap in GitHub. The roadmap is similar to a GANT diagram.

[Roadmap](https://github.com/users/fo-b/projects/2/views/3)

<br>

## Resource plan

| Name, First name | Roles                      |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| Beti, Fabio      | Project owner & manager    |  
| Rohr, Phillip    | Expert & Project management|   
| Armin, Doerzbach | Expert IaS                 | 

<br>

The resource plan shows which employees take on which roles.  I am the project manager and also carry out the practical implementation, but also the main contact person. Then I have Philipp Rohr he is the contact if I have questions or troubles around project management. Also, I have Armin Doerzbach, which is the expert in IaS.

## SWOT analysis

![SWOT](/img/swot.png)

As you can see in the SWOT analysis, there are several strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. One of my strategies will be that I am looking to gain such knowledge as I can about the framework Ansible. 

Since I have quite a lot of information to read and to process, the information, is it necessary that I can build a strong foundation to Ansible and possible forums to also get possible help.

## Budget

In this project, I could manage it that I don't produce any costs at all. This means I was able to save money, but anyway, build such a great idea for free. This was only possible to thank of maas.io, the AWS Academy Lab and of course the Technische Berufsschule ZÃ¼rich.
